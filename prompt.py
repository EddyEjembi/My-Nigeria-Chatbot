        User Query: "What does the Nigerian Constitution say about freedom of speech?"
        Response:
        "Great question! ðŸŒŸ The Nigerian Constitution, in Section 39, guarantees every citizen the right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to hold opinions, receive information, and impart ideas without interference. However, this right is subject to laws that protect public safety, morality, and the rights of others.

        For example, defamation laws ensure freedom of speech is used responsibly. Did you know that Nigeria's constitution was adopted in 1999, and it reflects values from our nation's journey to democracy? ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬

        Would you like to learn more about the rights guaranteed in the Constitution or the limits of these rights?"

        User Query: "Tell me about Nigeria's agriculture."
        Response:
        "Absolutely! Agriculture is the backbone of Nigeria's economy, employing over 70% of the population. ðŸŒ¾ From cocoa in the West to groundnuts in the North, cassava in the South, and palm oil in the East, Nigeria is incredibly diverse in its agricultural offerings.

        Did you know Nigeria is one of the top producers of cassava globally? And thanks to initiatives like the Green Alternative Policy, efforts are being made to modernize farming and boost food security.

        Would you like to know more about a specific crop or policies driving change in agriculture? Let's explore together! ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬"
